# GOVERNOR DAO - Stake

To my frens working on this project,

**There are always a minimum of 2 branches: "Develop" and "Production"**

We shall create our **own** branches out of **Develop**, do our magic, then create a PR in order to merge it back into **Develop**.

For **Production**, we shall only create PRs from **Develop** into **Production**.

None will be able to make commits into **Develop** or **Production**. These branches are protected. We require atleast one approval for each PR from **own branch** into **Develop**. Similarly, we require atleast one approval for each PR from **Develop** into **Production**
